This file summarised the condition of each video sequence. The sequence order in the dataset is arranged based on 
the imaging condition complex, with sequence 1 (low frame rate) the simplest and clearest video background to the
sequence 10 (high frame rate) the most complex and worst video background, to check the effect of the imaging condition
to the performance of segmentation, detection and further tracking results when being tested with various segmentation 
and tracking algorithms.

•	Seq.1 with 4 zebrafish larvae in clear round well will shadow at well edge, shooting at 14 f/s of 280 frames.
