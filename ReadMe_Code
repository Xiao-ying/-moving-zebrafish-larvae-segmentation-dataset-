This file explains the usage of included binary and MATLAB code. Detailed information of each script is listed inside each script.

BackgroundSubtractionOpenCV.exe is the executable file that you can run from command window, to do background subtraction using
the mixture of Gaussian model method. Both video and images formats accept. 

MATALB script UPostProcess.m do the post processing after get background subtraction results by BackgroundSubtractionOpenCV.exe. 

UCreateFrameFromVideo.m supplies an option to creat video frames from a video and stores the video frames of a video in a file named "VideoFrame" in the 
current folder when you run this MATLAB m file, if you prefer run images on BackgroundSubtractionOpenCV.exe. 

USegmentationEvaluation.m, working together with the function script RemoveDirect.m in the same directory, 
tests the segmentation accuracy of your segmentation results comparing with the ground truth. 

UCaculateConfidenceInterval.m calculates the confidence intervals for the set of four parameters by the folder storing the MAT results
after runing the USegmentationEvaluation.m programe.


The following scripts help creat and check ground truth for your video frames or videos.

UCreateFrameFromVideo.m supplies an option to creat video frames from a video and stores the video frames of a video in a file named "VideoFrame" in the 
current folder when you run this MATLAB m file, if you prefer run images on BackgroundSubtractionOpenCV.exe. 

UCheckSegmentResultProposedDataset.m conducts checking function of the generated ground truth images with their original images.
